DEA Sandbox disclaimer
======================

**To the maximum extent permitted by law, your use of the Digital Earth Australia Sandbox (including any associated data or services):  
    - Is on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis with all faults, and the Commonwealth of Australia disclaims all warranties, guarantees or representations of any kind, and 
    - Is entirely at your own risk, and the Commonwealth of Australia disclaims any liability to you or anyone else for any liability whatsoever (including, without limitation, any liability for negligence). 
The Commonwealth of Australia does not intend to create any contractual legal relations with you in relation to your registration for, or use of, the Digital Earth Australia Sandbox (including any associated data or services).** 

Purpose 
-------
The Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Sandbox is a learning and analysis environment for getting started with DEA data and our `Open Data Cube`_. It is intended to enable you to experiment and learn how to use DEA's Earth Observation datasets and enable you to explore proof-of-concept applications that you may wish to implement in your own production environment. 

Availability 
------------
Geoscience Australia makes no guarantee on the availability of the DEA Sandbox and may discontinue offering the DEA Sandbox without notice. We may change the features and datasets offered in response to user feedback and future assessments of budget and security. 

Geoscience Australia currently has no limits on the number of persons who can create an account for the DEA Sandbox. However, there is a technical limit on the number of concurrent users who can be logged into the DEA Sandbox and if this limit is reached other users will receive an error message and be unable to login. 

We may remove your files at any time without warning. If you need files hosted in the Sandbox you should download or export them regularly. 

We define an account as inactive if it has not been logged into for the last 90 days and may remove the data of inactive accounts. After this data is removed, new logins will result in a fresh workspace.  

In the event that a user's environment becomes unstable, it will be replaced with a fresh environment and all work/data may be lost. 

As explained below, we may suspend accounts that we consider have misused the DEA Sandbox. 

You can view the current system status `here`_. If you are experiencing an issue with the Sandbox that isn't identified on the status page, please submit this issue to `earth.observation@ga.gov.au`_ as we may be able to assist you to the extent we consider appropriate.  

Security 
--------
Geoscience Australia cannot guarantee the security of data in your account and you should not use your account with sensitive or confidential data.

-------------------------
Geoscience Australia will consider that the following is misuse of the DEA Sandbox and may choose to suspend your account:

Collection of personal information 
----------------------------------
Your personal information provided at sign up is collected under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act). We will only use and disclose your personal information to administer, evaluate and improve the DEA Sandbox, unless you provide consent or we are otherwise required or authorised by law to use or disclose it. Your files will not be intentionally shown to other users or shared with third parties but as explained above we cannot guarantee the security of your account.
