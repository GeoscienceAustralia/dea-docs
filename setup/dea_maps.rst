4. We can now add data to the map. In this example, we will load 10 m resolution satellite imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites. First, click on "Satellite data" to open this folder, then click on the "DEA Surface Reflectance (Sentinel-2)" product. This will show you a preview of the data we are about to load. When you are ready, click "Add to the map".
