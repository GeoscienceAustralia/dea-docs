The Digital Earth Australia analysis environment is currently available for
Australian government and academic users eligible for accounts on `National
Computational Infrastructure`_ (NCI).

Use the `NCI Account Sign Up`_ page with your government or academic
institutional email address.


.. important::
   When signing up, you need to join some :ref:`data_access` projects 
   to access the DEA data.

Commercial access
=================

Commercial entities wanting to participate in project partnerships or training
with DEA should contact the |DEA Helpdesk|.

NCI can also provision compute and storage resources to commercial entities
under contract for those looking to leverage DEA resources. It is suggested that
commercial entities contact the  |DEA Helpdesk| to help determine requirements.

.. |DEA Helpdesk| replace:: `DEA Helpdesk <mailto:earth.observation@ga.gov.au>`_

Australian Research Environment
===============================

The easiest way to use Digital Earth Australia on the NCI is to use their
:term:`Australian Research Environment<ARE>`. It allows you to sign in and access
Virtual Desktop and JupyterLab Notebook environments via a web browser.

It is possible to run on the NCI's Gadi_ :term:`HPC` Supercomputer, but unless
you're experience with :term:`SSH` and HPC systems, it's a lot easier to get
started on :term:`ARE` first.

Data Access
===========

DEA Data is stored on several "GData filesystems" on the NCI. To access the data you 
need to request access to one or more of the **Projects** listed below.

Use `MyNCI <https://my.nci.org.au/>`_ to view and manage your project memberships.

High Performance Computing
==========================

The DEA environment can be accessed within the High Performance Computing (HPC)
environment (i.e. Gadi_). This will require compute and storage quota
allocations to be made via NCI's Allocation Scheme processes, on a per-project
basis. This does not need to be specific to DEA â€“ all users with computing
capabilities on Gadi are able to access DEA through the HPC system.

This guide focuses on accessing and exploring DEA via the VDI environment.
