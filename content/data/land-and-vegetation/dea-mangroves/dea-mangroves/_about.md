Tracking changes in the canopy density of mangroves, Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Mangrove Canopy Cover reveals how these extraordinary trees may be responding to sea level rise, severe tropical cyclones, drought, climatic cycles, changing temperatures and large storm events.

Mangroves provide a diverse array of ecosystem services but these are impacted upon by both natural and anthropogenic drivers of change. In Australia, mangroves are protected by law and hence the natural drivers predominate.

It is important to understand the canopy density of mangroves in Australia so that we can measure how mangroves are responding to sea level rise, severe tropical cyclones and climatic cycles.
