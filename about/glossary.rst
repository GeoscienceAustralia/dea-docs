      cloud-free imagery mosaics of Australia's coast, estuaries and reefs at low 
      and high tide.
      
   ITEM
      Intertidal Extents Model, a Digital Earth Australia product that maps the 
      relative extent of the Australian intertidal zone at regular intervals of 
      the observed tidal range.

   Landsat
      Satellites from NASA that have publicly available Earth Observation data.

      Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance with terrain illumination reflectance 
      correction.
   
   NBR
      Normalised Burn Ratio, calculated from near-infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared
      (SWIR).

   NCI
      The Australian National Computational Infrastructure is Australia's
      national research computing facility. It provides computing facilities for
      use by Australian researchers, industry and government. For more
      information see http://www.nci.org.au/.

   NDVI
      Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, calculated from visible and near-infrared
      light reflected by vegetation. 
   
   NIDEM
      National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model, a Digital Earth Australia product 
      derived from ITEM that maps the elevation relative to Mean Sea Level of the 
      Australian intertidal zone. 
      
   NIR
      Near Infrared, referring to particular bands used to collect Earth observation 
      data
   
   ODC
      Open Data Cube, an international open-source project developing the technology
      that powers Digital Earth Australia. For more information see
      http://opendatacube.org/ .

   PostgreSQL
      The high performance database engine used as an index of Datasets by the
      Data Cube. It is both a relational and document database, and the Data
      Cube schema makes use of both of these capabilities.

   Python
      The programming language used to develop the Data Cube. It is easy to use
      while still allowing high performance access and processing capabilities.
      See http://www.python.org/ for more.

   SAR
      Synthetic Aperture Radar
