   AGDC
      The Australian Geoscience Data Cube, an Australian implementation of the
      ODC.

   API
      The Data Cube Application Programming Interface gives programmers full
      access to the capabilities of the Cube, allowing query and advanced data
      retrieval.

   HLTC
      High and Low Tide Composites, a Digital Earth Australia product providing
      cloud-free imagery mosaics of Australia's coast, estuaries and reefs at low 
      and high tide.
      
   ITEM
      Intertidal Extents Model, a Digital Earth Australia product that maps the 
      relative extent of the Australian intertidal zone at regular intervals of 
      the observed tidal range.

   NBAR
      Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance, where BRDF stands for Bidirectional
      reflectance distribution function.
      
   NBAR-T
      Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance with terrain illumination reflectance 
      correction.

   NCI
      The Australian National Computational Infrastructure is Australia's
      national research computing facility. It provides computing facilities for
      use by Australian researchers, industry and government. For more
      information see http://www.nci.org.au/.

   NIDEM
      National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model, a Digital Earth Australia product 
      derived from ITEM that maps the elevation relative to Mean Sea Level of the 
      Australian intertidal zone. 
      
   ODC
      Open Data Cube, an international open-source project developing the technology
      that powers Digital Earth Australia. For more information see
      http://opendatacube.org/ .

   PostgreSQL
      The high performance database engine used as an index of Datasets by the
      Data Cube. It is both a relational and document database, and the Data
      Cube schema makes use of both of these capabilities.

   Python
      The programming language used to develop the Data Cube. It is easy to use
      while still allowing high performance access and processing capabilities.
      See http://www.python.org/ for more.

      United States Geological Survey
      
   VDI
      Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a virtual laboratory at NCI that provides a
      linux desktop environment for scientific computing. For more see
      http://vdi.nci.org.au/help.
      
   WOfS
      Water Observations from Space, a Digital Earth Australia product that provides
      images and data showing where water has been seen in Australia from 1987 to 
      the present. 

   YAML
      YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming
      languages. It is used for all on disk metadata files and product
      definitions in the Data Cube.

      For more information on the YAML standard see http://yaml.org/.
