   AGDC
      The Australian Geoscience Data Cube prototype, an early Australian 
      implementation of the Open Data Cube. The AGDC has since been superseded by 
      Digital Earth Australia.

   API
      The Open Data Cube Application Programming Interface gives programmers full
      access to the capabilities of the Cube, allowing query and advanced data
      retrieval.
      
   ARD

      set of corrections applied, making it ready for use in scientific analyses.

   ARE
      The `Australian Research Environment <https://are.nci.org.au/>`_ is a tool for
      using the data and software available on the :term:`NCI`. It is a replacement 
      the old :term:`VDI` system.
      
   AWS
      One of the two environments used for hosting Digital Earth Australia.
      Amazon Web Services is a commercial cloud computing provider. Used
      by Digital Earth Australia for our JupyterHub Sandbox and Web Mapping 
      Services.
   
   BRDF
      "Bidirectional reflectance distribution function" is a theoretical concept 
      that describes the relationship between light and an opaque surface, 
      using a target's irradiance geometry and the remote sensing systemâ€™s 
      relative angle to the target.
   
   C2
   Collection 2
      Digital Earth Australia's second collection of Landsat data. Now 
      superceded by :term:`Collection 3` (C3).

   Collection
     C1, C2, C3 ...n - the whole suite of data from the Landsat or Sentinel mission. 
     Collections are updated when there are fundamental changes and upgrades to the data suite that 
     make it incompatible with the existing collection. Therefore a collection upgrade is more 
     akin to a movie franchise reboot than a re-release.
