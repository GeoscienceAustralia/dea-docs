### About the waterbody graphs

:::{dropdown} Is this product showing waterbody volume?
No. DEA Waterbodies does not measure the volume of water in any waterbody.

The tool detects the wet surface area of a waterbody. The wet surface area does not correlate to the volume of water in a storage. For example a waterbody can be observed as wet with just a shallow covering of water.
