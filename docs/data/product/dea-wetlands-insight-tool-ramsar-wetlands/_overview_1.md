## About

Our precious wetlands are dynamic and diverse environments. The Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Wetlands Insight Tool (Ramsar) gives visibility of changes to the amount of water, green vegetation, dry vegetation, and bare soil that have taken place in Australia's Ramsar wetlands since 1987.
