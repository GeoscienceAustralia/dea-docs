## Accuracy

Flyover schedules are only indicative of potential acquisitions and will differ from what is actually downlinked from satellites by each ground station:

* The timings and footprints are relevant for a selection of ground stations in the [ANGSTT network](http://www.angstt.gov.au/) (i.e. operating on the Australian continent only). Some ground stations are omitted, such as those operating in Antarctica. They do not reflect actual ground station reception schedules.
* Satellite overpass timings and footprints are accurate only within a few days of the current date. The information should be used with caution for dates lagging or exceeding the current date by more than 10 days.
* 'Start' and 'end' times indicate the earliest and latest time a particular satellite is visible from a given location. They are based on the locationâ€™s altitude and minimum angle the antenna can see over the horizon. That angle is set between 2 and 5 degrees for different stations to better reflect actual acquisition capabilities of each ground station.
* A satellite may be visible from a particular ground station, but it does not mean the station is used for, or is capable of, transferring the data acquired by that satellite. E.g. no data from the Sentinel constellation of satellites is downloaded by the ANGSTT network of ground stations.
* Calculated 'start' and 'end' times may not precisely reflect actual acquisition schedules of individual ground stations in the ANGSTT network. The differences could be due to:
    1. stations not having the capability of downlinking the data from a particular satellite
    1. stations not having the capacity to downlink data from multiple satellites at the same time (hence only higher priority satellites are scheduled for downlink to a particular station)
    1. ground station operators adjusting the acquisition time to accommodate satellites passing in quick succession and/or to limit data acquisition over the open ocean
    1. for various operational purposes, operators specifying different parameters to those used as input into calculations in this app

## Quality assurance

Validation of calculated predictive schedules and ground footprints was based on sample of actual acquisition schedules published by Alice Springs, Murdoch and Hobart ground stations, and actual imagery acquired by Geoscience Australia for the purpose of generation of [DEA Hotspots](https://hotspots.dea.ga.gov.au/) .
