## Accuracy

### Missing Hotspots

Hotspots may be obscured or missing from the map due to the following reasons:

* Polar Orbiting satellites are not designed to provide live updates on fire fronts, as they only look over the fire ground 4-7 times per day.
* Optical satellites cannot see though clouds, heavy smoke or tree canopy.  
* Fires may be missed if they are relatively small or do not cover a spatial footprint large enough to be detected by the sensors (e.g. the MODIS footprint is 1km2).  
* Cool fires are not likely to be detected.  
* Sensors can be inoperable for extended periods of time, disrupting the detection of Hotspots.  
* The fire may have been burning during a time when no satellite was looking over the fire ground.  

### False Hotspots

At times, the AVHRR sensor on the NOAA satellites will register a line of false Hotspots which follow the path of the satellite pass. Usually, these can be seen moving from south-east to north-west along the edge of the sensor image. These should be disregarded as potential Hotspots.
