## Use constraints

* False positives (showing a Hotspot without an underlying cause) are possible. 
* False negatives (failing to show a Hotspot, despite a heated land surface, fire, etc.) are possible.  
 
* Hotspots are potential bushfires, but could also indicate other phenomena, such as gas fires, heavy industry, furnaces, jet contrails and hot rocks. 
 
* Not all fires will be detected as Hotspots.  
 
* The Hotspot location on any map (no matter how detailed) is only accurate to ± 2.0 km at best. 
 
* Hotspots are not presented in real-time and not designed to be used in isolation of other data sources. It is not accurate enough to be relied upon for time-critical detection and location of fires. 
 
* Geostationary satellite derived products algorithms may be optimised for day or night conditions.  For algorithms such as BRIGHT that provide hotspots every 10 minutes, 24 hours per day, temporal windows approximately +/- 1 hour of sunset and sunrise are considered unreliable periods.  
 
* No Hotspots are produced if satellite data is not received (e.g. for AHI, 0240 and 1440 UTC times are not received).

* Hotspots can indicate possible active fires in some circumstances. Taken as an ensemble, Hotspots provide an overview of thermal activity in Australia and capture the pattern of possible fires across the Australian continent over time. 
 
* Emergency management agencies use Hotspots as one of many operational data feeds to inform their broad situational awareness of, and at times tactical response to, fires. 
 
* Hotspots should not be used for safety of life decisions. For local updates and alerts, please refer to your state emergency or fire service. 
 
* Depending on the sensor, generally, a flaming or smouldering fire would need to be at least 1,000 m2 to be recognised as a Hotspot. Under exceptional (and rare) conditions (no cloud, smoke, wind etc), a flaming fire at 50m2 may be detected (Giglio et al., 2003). However, fires are often smaller than the size of the satellite pixel.
