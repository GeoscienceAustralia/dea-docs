## About

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Intertidal Suite provides a range of products to characterise Australia's intertidal zone â€” the area between the highest tide mark and the lowest. The suite contains a 10m resolution elevation product for our tidal flats, rocky shores and reefs, along with an intertidal exposure product which enables users to examine periods of exposure and inundation across the intertidal zone.
