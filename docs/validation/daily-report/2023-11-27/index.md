:::{figure} ./DayComparison-2023-11-27.png

A band-by-band plot of surface reflectance for satellite (blue) and field (red) data. Satellite uncertainty error bars for each band are the standard deviation of pixel values 
over and surrounding the field site. Field uncertainty error bars are the standard deviation of values after averaging all spectra within the same satellite pixels.

Satellite Surface Reflectance versus Field Site Surface Reflectance on this day are shown in coloured symbols, as per the insetted legend.
Black dots represent the values from all previous field site measurements prior to 2023-11-27. The solid line represents the one-to-one line
of equality between field and satellite measurements. Parameters for the line of best fit through all shown points are given in the lower right.
Note that the line of best fit is NOT shown here.
