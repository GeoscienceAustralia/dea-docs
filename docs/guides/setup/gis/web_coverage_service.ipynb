    "A standard protocol for serving coverage data, which returns the data along with its original semantics (instead of just pictures) which may be interpreted, extrapolated, etc., and not just portrayed. With WCS you can retrieve the raw geospatial raster data behind an image for performing further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "WCS allows selecting and downloading subsets of full multispectral images at their original spatial resolution, without needing to download the entire file. This allows you to limit your downloads to only the information from your area of interest."
