Advanced Access - HPC and CLI

High Performance Computing
==========================

The DEA environment can be accessed within the High Performance Computing (HPC)
environment (i.e. Gadi_). This will require compute and storage quota
allocations to be made via NCI's Allocation Scheme processes, on a per-project
basis. This does not need to be specific to DEA â€“ all users with computing
capabilities on Gadi are able to access DEA through the HPC system.

Command Line Usage
==================

.. note:

   This section is intended for advanced users, and describes using DEA from
   a command line interface. This is mostly useful if you intend on running
   batch jobs on ``gadi`` and need to do some testing on the ``VDI``. Or simply if
   you're curious.


On ``VDI``, you can start a terminal window from **Applications** -> **System Tools**.

To manually use the modules on ``gadi`` or the ``VDI``, add the datacube module path

.. code-block:: bash

   $ module use /g/data/v10/public/modules/modulefiles/

(you can add the above to your ``.bashrc`` to avoid running it every time)

You should now be able to load the ``dea`` module by running

.. code-block:: bash

   $ module load dea

.. note::
   Behind the scenes this will load a second module called ``dea-env``
   which contains all required libraries and supporting software to use ``dea``.
   

You can see a list of available modules by running

.. code-block:: bash

   $ module avail


The first time you load the module, it will register your account with the datacube, granting you read-only access.

It will store your password in the file ``~/.pgpass``.

You can then launch a Jupyter notebook by running

.. code-block:: bash

   $ jupyter-lab <path_to_notebook>

.. note::
    ``VDI`` and ``gadi`` have separate home directories, so you must copy your pgpass to the other if
    you use both environments.

    You can push the contents of your pgpass file from the ``VDI`` to ``gadi`` by running on a terminal window in VDI

    .. code-block:: bash

       remote-hpc-cmd init
       ssh gadi "cat >> ~/.pgpass" < ~/.pgpass
       ssh gadi "chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass"

    You will most likely be prompted for your NCI password.

    To pull the contents of your pgpass from ``gadi`` to the ``VDI`` instead, run

    .. code-block:: bash

       ssh gadi "cat ~/.pgpass" >> ~/.pgpass
       chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass

.. warning::

    If you have created a ``.datacube.conf`` file in your home folder from
    early Data Cube betas, you should rename or remove it to avoid it
    conflicting with the settings loaded by the module.
