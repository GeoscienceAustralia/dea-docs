## What it is

DEA Access serves an online spatial catalogue of priority Geoscience Australia data collections that are hosted at the NCI. This is a complementary service to THREDDS, providing open WebMap access to DEA datasets.

The DEA Access portal offers search and discovery tools to make it simple and easy to access the DEA collections that are hosted on the NCI file servers. Most importantly, this allows the user community to download DEA base data and derivative products for specialised processing and further analysis.
